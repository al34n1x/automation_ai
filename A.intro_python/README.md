Python is a great, beginner-friendly programming language because it was originally designed with learners in mind. It is also used by professional developers in a wide range of applications, like web programming, data science, artificial intelligence, and DevOps. It is estimated that there are about 3 million Python programmers in the world, and by some accounts, it is the fastest growing, most widely used language, especially in high-GDP countries. Out of dozens of programming languages, Python is the third most loved language and is the number one language that current and aspiring developers want to learn.

As part of this course you will learn how to code using standar Python objects, functions and data mining libraries that will help you to find insights in your data.
Also, you will learn how to structure your code, use notebooks, and document your programs.
